# Japan-Weather-Data-Collection 🌦️

## Project Overview
Japan Weather Data Collection is an API-driven project that collects real-time weather data for various cities in Japan. The data is processed and stored in a MySQL database, capturing attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and more. This project aims to refine data parsing, address NULL value issues, and develop a front-end for visualization.
